# Nodus-App Security Guidelines Document

This document outlines the security principles and requirements for the Nodus-App project. The purpose is to ensure that security is embedded by design, following industry best practices, and addressing the needs of a custom Nostr client for communities.

---

## 1. Project Overview

- **Project Name:** Nodus-App
- **Type:** Custom Nostr client for communities
- **Goal:** Develop a mobile-friendly, secure, and engaging social platform
- **Target Audience:** Communities
- **Branding:** Adhere to nodus.social colors and logos; ensure a responsive, mobile-friendly design

### Core Features

- Main feed (live and cached content)
- User profiles with simplified private/public key management
- Following users
- Posting notes
- Private messaging (using NIP-04 initially, with potential integration of Whitenoise in the future)
- Local cache and offline functionality

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Svelte, Vite
- **Development Environment:** Replit (initial)
- **Deployment:** Docker (preferred) – alternatives include Podman or virtual environments
- **Local Storage:** IndexedDB (via Dexie)
- **Optional Backend:** Redis (for caching and temporary storage) with a SQLite fallback
- **Protocols:** NIP-01, NIP-04, NIP-05, NIP-07, NIP-13, NIP-42
- **Future Integrations:** Nostr Wallet Connect, AI features, push notifications
- **Microservices Communication:** WebSocket or Redis pub/sub

## 2. Core Security Considerations

### Security by Design (SDLC)

- Integrate security from the initial design phase through implementation and testing.
- Use a layered approach to security (Defense in Depth).
- Establish secure defaults for all components.

### Authentication & Key Management

- **Authentication:** Use a simple, robust strategy based on NIP-42 with simplified key management.
- **Session Management:** Generate unpredictable session IDs, enforce session timeouts, and offer secure logout functionalities.
- **Private Messaging:** Initially use NIP-04 for encryption; consider Whitenoise integration later for stronger encryption.

### User Roles & Access Control

- **Roles:** Regular users, Community originators, and Moderators.
- **Authorization:** Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) ensuring that every sensitive operation performs server-side checks.

### Data Protection & Privacy

- **Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data both in transit (using TLS 1.2 or above) and at rest.
- **Data Persistence:** Use IndexedDB for local storage with easy backend clearing. Sensitive data (keys, PII) should be encrypted.
- **Key Management:** Keep key management as simple as possible while ensuring secure storage and transmission.

### Offline Functionality

- Maintain a local cache of feeds using IndexedDB to support offline accessibility.
- Implement automatic synchronization when connectivity is restored.

### Monitoring & Logging

- Implement basic logging from the initial stages.
- Plan for advanced monitoring (e.g., community management backend, Prometheus) in later development phases.

## 3. Input Handling & API Security

- **Input Validation:** Assume all external inputs (user submissions, API requests) are untrusted. Validate and sanitize rigorously to prevent injection attacks.
- **API Security:** Secure each endpoint with appropriate authentication and RBAC. Use HTTPS and enforce TLS encryption for all API communications.
- **Rate Limiting:** Incorporate rate limiting and throttling to mitigate brute-force or denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

---

## 4. Infrastructure & Dependency Management

- **Containerization & Deployment:** Use Docker for deployment with a secure configuration. Harden container configurations to expose only necessary services and ports.
- **Fallback Considerations:** Use SQLite as a fallback if Redis is not available.
- **Software Updates:** Regularly update all dependencies (libraries, frameworks) and runtime environments to patch any vulnerabilities.
- **Secrets Management:** Avoid hardcoding secrets in source code. Use secure mechanisms (environment variables, dedicated vaults) to manage sensitive configuration details.

---

## 5. Secure Development Lifecycle Practices

- **Least Privilege:** Grant minimal permissions to components, users, and services.
- **Defense in Depth:** Apply multiple layers of security controls.
- **Input Validation & Output Encoding:** Sanitize all inputs and encode outputs to mitigate XSS and injection attacks.
- **Fail Securely:** Ensure error conditions do not reveal sensitive system or process information.
- **Secure File Uploads:** Validate file types, sizes, and perform necessary scans before processing or storing uploads.

## 6. Browser & Mobile-Specific Considerations

- **Responsive Design:** Ensure adherence to nodus.social branding guidelines through responsive, mobile-friendly UI/UX.
- **Client-Side Storage:** Use IndexedDB responsibly; avoid storing overly sensitive data on the client side.
- **Security Headers:** Implement HTTP security headers like Content-Security-Policy, Strict-Transport-Security, X-Frame-Options, and others to mitigate common web vulnerabilities.

---

## 7. Future Enhancements & Considerations

- **Private Messaging Enhancements:** Assess and potentially integrate advanced encryption services (e.g., Whitenoise) as user needs evolve.
- **Advanced Monitoring:** Explore richer monitoring and management tools as the community grows.
- **Microservices & API Expansion:** Gradually introduce third-party APIs using a microservices approach, ensuring each service maintains secure defaults and proper authorization checks.

## Conclusion

These guidelines are integral to ensuring that Nodus-App is built to be secure, resilient, and trustworthy from the ground up. Every component—from key management and data persistence to real-time feed synchronization—should adhere to best practices in secure coding and infrastructure hardening. Regular reviews, updates, and adherence to these practices will assist in maintaining a strong security posture as the app evolves.

Remember, security is a continuous process and not a one-time checklist. Any design changes or implementation decisions should be reviewed with these principles in mind.

*Note: If uncertainties arise regarding the security implications of any new feature or design, it is essential to flag and review them prior to production deployment.*
