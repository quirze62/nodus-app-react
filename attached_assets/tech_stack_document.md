# Tech Stack Document

This document explains the reasons behind our technology choices for Nodus-App. It is designed to be accessible to anyone, even if you aren’t a technical expert. Below, you’ll find each section broken down in everyday language with lists of the main technologies and a brief explanation on how they help deliver a smooth and secure user experience.

## Frontend Technologies

We chose a band of modern tools to guarantee that the app is fast, responsive, and easy to use. Here’s what we’re using:

- **Svelte**
  - A modern, reactive framework that simplifies building dynamic user interfaces. It allows us to write smaller and cleaner code, improving performance and making it easier to implement features like the beautiful onboarding flow and smooth transitions between the main feed and profile sections.

- **Vite**
  - A cutting-edge build tool that speeds up development and builds time. It ensures that the code is bundled efficiently with faster updates while keeping the application lightweight and responsive.

- **Dexie (for IndexedDB)**
  - A lightweight library to make working with IndexedDB easier. This tool handles local storage seamlessly so that content like feeds, messages, and user settings persist and remain available even when offline. It plays an essential role in offline functionality and data synchronization when users reconnect.

Together, these tools ensure that the user interface is engaging, mobile-friendly, and adheres to nodus.social’s light/dark mode design guidelines.

## Backend Technologies

The backend of Nodus-App is designed to manage data and support social interactions while leaving room for future scalability. The key components include:

- **Redis**
  - Used as an optional backend caching solution. It helps in rapidly storing and retrieving temporary data, which is important for keeping the app’s feed and messaging features responsive, especially under load.

- **SQLite**
  - Acts as a fallback option if Redis is not available or suitable. SQLite offers a simple yet effective way to manage the database requirements of the application in smaller, self-contained deployments.

- **Microservices Architecture (with WebSocket/Redis pub/sub)**
  - Although in the initial phase the backend is kept simple, the design is modular and microservice-ready. This expected architecture supports efficient communication between components (using WebSocket or Redis pub/sub), making it easier to scale functionalities like community management as the platform grows.

These backend choices are intended to balance simplicity with future expansion, ensuring that user data is handled securely and efficiently while offering robust performance.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

The infrastructure and deployment setup ensures that the app remains reliable and can be easily updated. We’re using:

- **Docker**
  - Docker containers package the application in a consistent environment, ensuring that what works in development works in production. This makes deployments predictable and reliable.

- **Replit**
  - In the early phase of the project, Replit provides a collaborative online coding environment, speeding up initial development and team collaboration.

- **CI/CD Pipelines (Potential Future Enhancement)**
  - While not fully implemented now, there is scope for integrating CI/CD pipelines. This would automate testing and deployment processes, reducing manual overhead and supporting ongoing reliability.

This combination makes for a solid, scalable infrastructure that supports iterative development and smooth roll-out of updates and new features.

## Third-Party Integrations

Apart from our core technologies, a few third-party integrations are planned to enhance the app’s functionality:

- **Nostr Protocols**
  - A set of protocols (NIP-01, NIP-04, NIP-05, NIP-07, NIP-13, and NIP-42) form the backbone of Nodus-App. These protocols support core functions like user authentication, encrypted messaging, and user identification in a secure and distributed way.

- **Nostr Wallet Connect (Future Integration)**
  - There are plans to integrate wallet connectivity in the future, allowing users to manage cryptographic keys and securely interact with the platform.

- **Possible Future Security Enhancements**
  - For enhanced encryption and security measures, future rounds may include integration with tools like Whitenoise, ensuring that sensitive communications are always protected.

Each integration is chosen with the focus on enhancing user interactions while keeping security, privacy, and performance at the forefront.

## Security and Performance Considerations

Security and high performance are crucial for trustworthy and enjoyable user experiences. Here’s how we address these aspects:

- **Secure Key Management and Encrypted Messaging (NIP-04 & NIP-42)**
  - The app uses standardized protocols for encryption and authentication to ensure that private messages and key exchanges are secure and easy to manage.

- **Efficient Local Storage with IndexedDB**
  - Through Dexie, we utilize IndexedDB to provide persistent local caching. This not only speeds up data access during offline use but also keeps the user experience fluid when reconnecting.

- **Modular and Scalable Design**
  - The chosen architectures and fallback options (Redis and SQLite) allow for additional security features to be integrated as needed without major overhauls.

- **Performance Optimizations**
  - Adopting Svelte and Vite ensures that the frontend remains lightweight and responsive, while Dockerized deployments provide consistent performance across environments.

- **Future Monitoring Possibilities**
  - Though not implemented immediately, the system is designed to integrate monitoring tools like Prometheus in later stages to track essential performance metrics.

This layered approach to security and performance guarantees that both user data is protected and the application remains fast and efficient.

## Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

To sum up, here’s how all the pieces of our tech stack come together:

- **Frontend:** Svelte, Vite, and Dexie for a lightweight, responsive, and mobile-friendly interface.

- **Backend:** A flexible setup using Redis (with SQLite as a fallback) and a microservices architecture for scalable data handling and community management.

- **Infrastructure:** Docker provides reliable, containerized deployments, initially powered by Replit’s collaborative environment, with future CI/CD automations in sight.

- **Third-Party and Protocol Integrations:** Integration of key Nostr protocols supports secure social interactions, complemented by potential wallet and advanced security integrations down the line.

- **Security and Performance:** Comprehensive measures including encrypted messaging, secure key management, and local caching ensure a safe, fast, and stable user experience.

This well-rounded tech stack is designed to meet the project’s goals of creating a secure, engaging, and scalable social application for communities. Each technology choice aligns with our goal of combining simplicity with robust functionality, ensuring that Nodus-App can grow with its users while maintaining a top-notch user experience.
