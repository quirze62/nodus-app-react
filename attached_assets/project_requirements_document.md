# Project Requirements Document for Nodus-App

## 1. Project Overview

Nodus-App is a custom Nostr client designed specifically for communities, offering a social platform where users can engage with each other securely and seamlessly. It focuses on delivering a streamlined experience for activities such as posting notes, private messaging (using NIP-04 for encryption), and managing private/public keys easily. The app is built with a mobile-friendly, responsive design that follows nodus.social branding, ensuring consistency in light/dark mode appearances and overall aesthetics.

The app is being built to simplify secure and engaging social interactions while implementing core Nostr protocols like NIP-01, NIP-05, NIP-07, NIP-13, and NIP-42. Major objectives include an intuitive onboarding process, a smooth main feed that handles both live and locally cached content, and modular architecture ready for future enhancements like community management, wallet integrations, and potential AI support. Success is measured by ease of use, reliability when offline, and smooth transitions between local data and backend synchronization.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**

*   Building a custom Nostr client focused on communities.

*   Developing core social features:

    *   Main feed displaying recent events and posts.
    *   User profile management with simple private/public key setup.
    *   Following other users and accessing their profiles.
    *   Creating and reading posts (notes).
    *   Secure private messaging following NIP-04 standards.

*   Integrating local storage using IndexedDB (via Dexie) for caching feeds, messages, and settings.

*   Implementing a simple, mobile-first, responsive UI that respects nodus.social’s branding and supports light/dark modes.

*   Setting up an authentication flow based on NIP-42 with minimal complexity.

*   Providing an optional backend integration initially using Redis (with fallback to SQLite) for caching and temporary storage.

*   Basic logging and preparation for future modular, microservice-ready enhancements.

**Out-of-Scope:**

*   Advanced third-party integrations (e.g., complete push notifications or additional third-party APIs) in the initial release.
*   Complex AI integrations beyond the groundwork for future internal agent support.
*   In-depth community management features that require dedicated moderator or administrator interfaces—these features will be enhanced in later phases.
*   Comprehensive CI/CD and full production-level monitoring (e.g., Prometheus) for the initial build.
*   Any extensive wallet integrations (e.g., Nostr Wallet Connect) until after the core functionalities are stable.

## 3. User Flow

When a new user launches Nodus-App, they are welcomed with a clear onboarding process. The app immediately presents an intuitive authentication screen where users can generate or import their private/public key pair with guidance based on NIP-42. Once authenticated, the user is directed to a dashboard that shows the main feed, complete with recent posts and events. The navigation is simple, featuring a left sidebar (or a bottom navigation bar on mobile) to transition between the main feed, user profiles, and messaging sections.

After exploring the main feed, users can visit their profile to view or update personal details, manage cryptographic keys, and switch between light and dark modes in line with nodus.social branding. The app enables social interactions by letting users follow others, engage with posts, and send private messages, all while locally caching data via IndexedDB. Offline usage is seamless; users can continue browsing previously loaded content, and once connectivity is re-established, the app automatically synchronizes the local cache with the backend.

## 4. Core Features

*   **Main Feed:**

    *   Displays recent posts and events from the network.
    *   Integrates live and locally cached content for seamless offline use.
    *   Optimized for smooth scrolling on both desktop and mobile devices.

*   **User Profiles & Key Management:**

    *   Simple interface for generating/importing private/public key pairs.
    *   Displays user information and cryptographic identity.
    *   Incorporates NIP-05 for user identification and NIP-07 for client-side signing.

*   **Social Interactions:**

    *   Allow users to follow and view other community members' profiles.
    *   Enable posting of notes and content sharing across the platform.

*   **Private Messaging:**

    *   Supports encrypted communication using NIP-04.
    *   Provides an interface for direct, secure interactions between users.
    *   Future possibility to integrate additional security layers like Whitenoise.

*   **Local Cache & Offline Functionality:**

    *   Utilizes IndexedDB (via Dexie) to persist user data, posts, and messages.
    *   Ensures feed availability and synchronization after reconnecting online.

*   **Optional Backend Integration:**

    *   Implements caching using Redis with fallback to SQLite if necessary.
    *   Prepares for modular microservice-ready architecture to support further community management features.

## 5. Tech Stack & Tools

*   **Frontend:**

    *   Svelte (framework for building reactive web applications)

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

*   The project assumes a development environment provided primarily through Replit during the initial phase.
*   Docker is assumed as the preferred deployment method, though alternatives like Podman may be used if Docker is not viable locally.
*   The application relies on consistent availability of core Nostr protocols (e.g., NIP-42 for authentication), and any changes within these protocols might require adjustments in the implementation.
*   Local storage via IndexedDB is assumed to persist data across sessions but must allow for clear and manageable synchronization with an optional backend.
*   The optional backend integration (using Redis, with a fallback to SQLite) is assumed to be manageable modularly, ready for expansion as user increase demands.
*   User role differentiation (regular users, moderators, community managers) is kept simple in the initial build with plans for future enhancements.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   Synchronization Challenges:

    *   Ensuring smooth and conflict-free synchronization between IndexedDB (local cache) and the optional backend may be complex, especially when users go from offline to online states.

*   Backend Integration Variability:

    *   Depending on whether Redis or SQLite is used for caching, performance may vary. Clear guidelines for transitioning or choosing between them should be established early.

*   Security Implementation:

    *   While basic encryption for private messaging is planned, the integration of additional security measures (like Whitenoise) may require careful refactoring in later rounds.

*   User Authentication Flow:

    *   Simplifying the key management process without compromising security can be a balancing act. Extensive testing is needed to maintain simplicity without introducing vulnerabilities.

*   Mobile Optimization:

    *   Achieving a responsive design that works perfectly on various devices requires rigorous UI testing. Limited screen space on mobile devices might present layout challenges.

*   Future Expansion and Microservices:

    *   The modular, microservice-ready architecture is intended for future expansion but could introduce complexity in component communication (e.g., via WebSocket or Redis pub/sub). Clear documentation and robust interfacing guidelines will be essential.
