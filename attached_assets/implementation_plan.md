# Implementation plan

Below is a detailed, step-by-step implementation plan for Nodus-App. Please ensure you run a prevalidation step to check if the current directory is already a project before executing the initialization steps.

---

## Phase 1: Environment Setup

1. **Prevalidation**: Check if the current directory already contains a project. If yes, back it up or choose a new directory. *(Reference: Project Goal section)*
2. **Install Node.js & NPM**: Verify that Node.js is installed (recommended version as needed by Vite/Svelte). Run `node -v` and `npm -v` as a validation. *(Reference: Tech Stack: Frontend)*
3. **Initialize Project using Vite Svelte Template**: In Replit or your local development environment, run the command:
   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest nodus-app -- --template svelte
   ```
   This creates a new Svelte project using Vite. *(Reference: Tech Stack: Frontend)
4. **Navigate to Project Directory**: Change directory to the new project folder: `cd nodus-app`.
5. **Install Project Dependencies**: Run `npm install` to install all required packages. *(Reference: Tech Stack: Frontend)
6. **Validation**: Run `npm run dev` to launch the development server and confirm that the default Svelte app appears in the browser.

---

## Phase 2: Frontend Development

7. **Design/Layout Setup**: Create a responsive layout that is mobile-friendly and supports both light and dark modes in accordance with nodus.social branding. *(Reference: User Interface section)
8. **PWA Compatibility**: Integrate Vite’s PWA plugin for service worker registration and offline support. Update `vite.config.js` and add a `manifest.webmanifest` in the public folder. *(Reference: User Interface section)
9. **Main Feed Component**: Create a Svelte component for the main feed at `src/components/MainFeed.svelte` that displays recent events and notes. *(Reference: Core Features section)
10. **Profile Component**: Create `src/components/UserProfile.svelte` where users can view and manage their public/private keys and profiles. *(Reference: Core Features section)
11. **Authentication Component**: Build an authentication interface (e.g., simple login form) at `src/components/Auth.svelte` that enables users to sign in using a simple setup. *(Reference: User Experience section)
12. **Post & Note Component**: Create `src/components/PostNote.svelte` allowing users to post new notes and interact with existing ones. *(Reference: Core Features section)
13. **Private Messaging Component**: Develop a component at `src/components/PrivateMessage.svelte` for NIP-04 based encrypted private messaging. *(Reference: Core Features & Security sections)
14. **Local Caching with IndexedDB**: Integrate Dexie for managing local caching. Create a new file `src/services/db.js` that initializes Dexie and defines tables for feeds, profiles, and messages. *(Reference: Data Handling section)
15. **Synchronization Logic**: In `src/services/sync.js`, implement logic to synchronize local IndexedDB-cached data with remote sources when the user comes online. *(Reference: Core Features & Data Handling sections)
16. **UI Routing**: Use a Svelte routing library (e.g., svelte-routing) to set up routes for main feed, profile, and messaging pages. Update `src/App.svelte` accordingly. *(Reference: User Interface section)
17. **Validation**: Run the development server and manually test each component (feed, profile, auth, messaging) in a mobile-sized browser window to confirm responsiveness and functionality.

## Phase 3: Optional Backend Development

*Note: The backend is optional. For this plan, we will configure a simple SQLite-based backend for functionalities such as cache clearing and temporary storage. This can be later swapped with Redis if needed.*

18. **Backend Setup Prevalidation**: Check if a backend directory exists. If not, create a new folder `/backend`.
19. **Initialize Backend Project**: In the `/backend` directory, initialize a Node.js project (or your preferred backend framework) by running `npm init -y`. *(Reference: Optional Backend section)
20. **Install Express and SQLite Dependencies**: Run `npm install express sqlite3` in the `/backend` directory. *(Reference: Optional Backend section)
21. **Create Database Schema**: Create a file `/backend/db/schema.sql` defining tables for cache (if needed) and user data. For example:
    - A `users` table storing user IDs and keys.
    - A `posts` table for user posts/notes.
    - A `messages` table for private messages.
   *(Reference: Data Handling and Core Features sections)
22. **Setup Express Server**: Create `/backend/server.js` with basic Express server configuration and API endpoints for:
    - Clearing local cache data
    - (Optional) Handling authentication requests
    - (Optional) Messaging endpoints
   *(Reference: Core Features & Optional Backend sections)
23. **Validation**: Run the backend server (`node server.js`) and test endpoints using tools like Postman or Curl to ensure they return appropriate responses.

---

## Phase 4: Integration

24. **Frontend-Backend API Integration**: In the frontend, create service modules (e.g., `src/services/api.js`) that make HTTP requests to the backend API endpoints for operations like cache clearing and authentication. *(Reference: App Flow & Optional Backend sections)
25. **WebSocket/Real-time Communication (if needed)**: For real-time updates (feed updates, messaging), integrate a WebSocket client in Svelte (or use libraries such as socket.io-client) and update both backend and frontend accordingly. *(Reference: Architecture section)
26. **Validation**: Test integration by performing end-to-end flows — for example, post a note on the frontend, let it be cached locally, and clear the cache via the backend API endpoint.

---

## Phase 5: Deployment

27. **Dockerization**: Create a `Dockerfile` in the project root for building the production image. The Dockerfile should handle both the frontend build (using Vite) and optionally include the backend server. *(Reference: Deployment section)
28. **Dockerfile Example for Frontend**:
    - FROM node:18-alpine
    - WORKDIR /app
    - COPY package*.json ./
    - RUN npm install
    - COPY . .
    - RUN npm run build
    - EXPOSE 3000
    - CMD [ "npm", "run", "preview" ]
   *(Adapt as needed; Reference: Deployment section)
29. **Local Testing in Docker**: Build and run the Docker image locally using:
    ```bash
    docker build -t nodus-app .
    docker run -p 3000:3000 nodus-app
    ```
    *(Reference: Deployment section)
30. **CI/CD Setup**: (Optional) Configure your preferred CI/CD tool to build and deploy Docker images automatically. *(Reference: Deployment section)
31. **Validation**: Confirm the deployed app is fully functional by accessing the production URL, testing key features (feed display, user profiles, messaging, caching behavior) in both light and dark modes.

---

## Final Pre-Launch Checks

32. **Security Review**: Verify that encryption is implemented for private messaging (NIP-04) and that keys are handled securely. *(Reference: Security section)
33. **Performance Review**: Test the app on mobile devices to ensure responsiveness and efficient IndexedDB caching. *(Reference: User Experience section)
34. **Documentation and Code Comments**: Ensure that all components and services are well documented and include inline comments for future maintainability. *(Reference: Project Goal section)
35. **Final Validation**: Run manual and automated tests on key functionalities (e.g., posting, authentication, cache sync) to ensure end-to-end integrity before full launch.

This plan outlines the initial steps to build a mobile-friendly, secure Nostr client with a focus on social and caching features. Adjust or extend steps as needed for future integrations such as Nostr Wallet Connect, push notifications, or third-party API services.

Happy coding!
